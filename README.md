# -RISC-V-Reference-SoC-Tapeout-Program-VSD
A warm welcome my side.This repository documents shows my participation in the VLSI System Design (VSD) "RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program," a comprehensive journey through the System-on-Chip (SoC) design flow. The project utilizes a 100% open-source EDA toolchain, including tools like Yosys, OpenLane, and Magic, to create a RISC-V based SoC.
